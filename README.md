# Identifying And Generating Content Polluter Tweets

All code used for our Data Mining (CSCI5523) Final Project. Our goal was to classify Twitter content polluters (bots) and generate our own polluter tweets using a text-generator RNN in order to demonstrate the difficulties of identifying bots in social media. Credit for the Twitter data goes to Lee et al., who have made their dataset publicly available at [http://infolab.tamu.edu/data/](http://infolab.tamu.edu/data/).
